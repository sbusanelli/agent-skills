description: Break work into small verifiable tasks with acceptance criteria and dependency ordering
context: fork
agent: Plan

Invoke the agent-skills:planning-and-task-breakdown skill.

Read the existing spec from the feature directory (docs/features/[feature-name]/spec.md) and the relevant codebase sections. Then:

1. Enter plan mode — read only, no code changes
2. Identify the dependency graph between components
3. Slice work vertically (one complete path per task, not horizontal layers)
4. Write tasks with acceptance criteria and verification steps
5. Add checkpoints between phases
6. Present the plan for human review

Save the plan and task list to the same feature directory:
- docs/features/[feature-name]/plan.md
- docs/features/[feature-name]/todo.md

This keeps all feature artifacts together and enables multiple simultaneous features.
